                <AboutMe>
                    I have over a year of professional experience as a Software Engineer at Ecumen where I
                    worked on ABXTracker. I started at Ecumen as an intern working on ABXTracker but when the internship
                    finished they decided to keep me on part-time while I was still in school. ABXTracker is used in
                    nursing homes to track infections as well as antibiotic and drug use. I mostly fixed bugs,
                    applied enhancements, and implemented new features.
                    <br/>
                    While working at Ecumen I also completed my capstone at Saint Cloud State University where I
                    worked as part of a team in an agile environment as well as communicating directly with the
                    stakeholders. My team was tasked with creating a web app that used machine learning to count
                    vehicles on a road and get the road condition by using a camera.
                    <br/>
                    I'm enthusiastic to learn new technologies and to collaborate with teammates for a successful project.
                    I thrive in a fast-paced dynamic environment knowing my work will make a difference, and I keep the
                    end-user in mind to achieve the best experience.
